                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p class="p1">
                Welcome to Lifestream, a platform dedicated to facilitating blood donation and saving lives. This website is developed by our team "Triple Threat," consisting of Vian Vargas, Fraizer Turingan, and Jethro Javier from section TN21. Our mission is to create a user-friendly and efficient platform that connects blood donors with those in need, providing crucial support in times of medical emergencies.<br>
                At Lifestream, we understand the importance of blood donation and the life-saving impact it has on countless individuals. Our platform allows users to register as blood donors, find recipients, and stay informed about blood donation drives and events. By bridging the gap between donors and recipients, we aim to foster a community of compassion and support.
                This project is our final output for our CCS0043L Application Development course, where we have applied our skills and knowledge to create a functional and meaningful web application.

            <h3>Facts about Blood Donations</h3>
                <p class="p1">
                Life-Saving Act: A single blood donation can save up to three lives. Blood is essential for surgeries, cancer treatment, chronic illnesses, and traumatic injuries.<br>
                Regular Need: Blood is in constant demand. Every two seconds, someone in the United States needs blood.<br>
                No Substitute: There is no artificial substitute for human blood. Donated blood is the only way to ensure a sufficient supply.<br>
                Blood Types: Different blood types are needed. While O-negative blood is the universal donor type and can be given to anyone, all blood types are necessary to meet patient needs.<br>
                Health Benefits for Donors: Regular blood donation can help lower the risk of heart disease and reduce the risk of certain cancers. It also helps in balancing iron levels in the body.<br>
